## CPP module 09 exercises


**Container rule:** Once a container is used in an exercise it is forbidden later. We should use at least one container per exercise; ex02 requires two different containers.


- [**ex00 — Bitcoin Exchange**](https://github.com/BrunoPosa/Hive-school-projects/tree/main/cpp/cpp09-STL_programs/ex00)  
  Parse the provided CSV price Database file and compute `date | value` outputs using the closest earlier DB date if exact date is missing. Validate dates/values and print results/errors.

- [**ex01 — Reverse Polish Notation**](https://github.com/BrunoPosa/Hive-school-projects/tree/main/cpp/cpp09-STL_programs/ex01)  
  Evaluate RPN expressions passed as a single argument. Support operations `+ - * /`. Print result or an error.

- [**ex02 — PmergeMe**](https://github.com/BrunoPosa/Hive-school-projects/tree/main/cpp/cpp09-STL_programs/ex02)  
  Implement the Ford–Johnson (merge-insert) sort for positive integers (support 3000+ values). Use two different STL containers and print: Before, After, and timing for each container.
